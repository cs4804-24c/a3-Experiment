# Description
For my experiment I decided to conduct the same study as the Cleveland and McGill experiment. I used a bar chart, a tree map, and a pie chart as the 3 visualizations for my experiment. The experiment was conducted on 10 of my friends, totalling 600 trials (200 for each chart). The results are shown below.

## Technical Achievement
- Added textfield focus and enter key functionality to allow users to quickly type and submit without using their mouse.
- Added csv download button to easily compile a master datafile

## Design Achievement
- Mimicked the example video as much as possible to give a very minimilistic approach to not have outside factors sway the results.
