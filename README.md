# Description:

For our experiment, we tested people's performance on three charts(Bar, Pie, and a Radar Chart). The performance was mainly evaluated based on accuracy. However, we also recorded the time it took participants to submit answers. We created a UI for the experiment and used a Google Script to send that data automatically to a google sheet. We got over 200 responses for each chart type. Overall in the experiment, it seemed the charts in terms of accuracy were in the following order 1. Bar Chart, 2. Pie Chart, 3. Radar Chart. For time, the average time it took from least to greatest is as follows 1. Bar, 2. Radar, 3. Pie

## Table with Time Averages by chart

Important note: these values are not the best representation of how long It took but does give a general idea about what charts people answer faster on. The reason for it not being the best representation is the data from the experiment was submitted after each guess and the time stamp of the submission was used to determine the time it took to answer a question. However, internet issues could affect time. In addition, we did remove some extreme outliers(ex: someone taking 70,000 seconds between answers) however there could still be some smaller outliers.

# UI 

## Into screen

The disagree button would bring the user to an about:blank page removing them from the experiment.

## End screen

Exit button would bring the user to an about:blank page removing them from the experiment.


# Technical Achievements 
- By following this tutorial https://github.com/levinunnink/html-form-to-google-sheet we were able to have our experiment automatically send data to a google sheet so data analysis could be easily done later on. This is an improvement over having to manually copy any data from an experiment after a user is done into a google or excel sheet and it means that someone can take this experiment from anywhere without the assistance of an experiment manager.
- We also developed a Radar chart which shows a greater knowledge of d3, HTML, and SVGs as you have to work with polygons and understand how to manipulate and rotate points to show up properly on a screen more than you do with simpler graphs like a pie chart or bar chart.

# Design Achievements

- Added a sliding bar to use to help select a number for the guess. However, a user could still enter a number if they wanted to
- Added a loading wheel that happens after each answer allowing the user to know when they can start to answer the next one
- developed a CSS file to better facilitate the UI design
