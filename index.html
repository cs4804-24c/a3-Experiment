        Welcome! In this experiment, you will be presented with a series of
        treemaps. Two of the sections will light up red, and your job is to
        determine the percentage of of the smaller section compared to the
        bigger section. For example: 100% means the smaller section is the same
        size as the larger section. 50% means the smaller section is half the
        size of the larger section.
      </p>

        At the end of the trials, you will be given the results of your
        performance. Press begin trials to start the experiment. Good Luck!
