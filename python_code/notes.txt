The datasaurus graph was sourced from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xaxpz3pm5r5awes/AADUbGVagF9i4RmM9JkPtviEa?dl=0. The data was translated to have a normal distribution, that is x and y means of 0 and x and y variance of 1.

The 02_margin_data.json contains the data for 50 graphs with statistical parameters very close to that of the datasaurus graph. Up to a 0.02 margin of error on the x and y means and standard deviations were allowed. Data was generated by quadrant so each quadrant contains the same number of data points as the associated quadrant in the datasaurus graph does.

If you want to manipulate or change how the graph are generated, go to the bottom of jarassic_graph.py
