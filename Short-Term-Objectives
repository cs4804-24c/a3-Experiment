Requirements:
Graphs have 3 symbols

Default data for blue data set to blue circles, then in 1-3 quadrants instead plot the blue data as X's

Randomly generate data set vs have 7 set graphs?

Display 7 graphs. 1 must have the dinosour from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xaxpz3pm5r5awes/AADUbGVagF9i4RmM9JkPtviEa?dl=0 depicted in green circles. Randomly choose which graph that is? Bias against the first graph?

Display graph for 1 sec or 2.5 sec (have option to choose), remove graph from screen, then after a 0.25 sec delay show the next graph.
